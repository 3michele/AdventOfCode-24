# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 - Solutions 🎅

This project contains my C++ implementations for all 25 challenges from the **Advent of Code 2024** event. 🎁

## 📚 Project Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, with each directory corresponding to a specific day's challenge. Here's the general structure:

```
/DayXX/
   ├── main1.cc
   ├── main2.cc
```

- **`main1.cc`**: Solution to the **first** part of the problem.
- **`main2.cc`**: Solution to the **second** part of the problem.

All source files refer to an **`input.txt`** file, randomly generated, which must be downloaded from the problem description on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.
